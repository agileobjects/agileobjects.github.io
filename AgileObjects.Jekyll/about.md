My name is Steve Wilkes. I'm a senior .NET programmer and hands-on architect from Bristol, UK.

In my couple of decades' experience, I've architected and written mission-critical, award-winning projects,
introduced Agile methodologies to Waterfall companies and worked extensively in all areas of the web stack. 
I'm comfortable talking plain English to stakeholders as well as techie to fellow programmers. 
I am always practicing, learning and improving.
