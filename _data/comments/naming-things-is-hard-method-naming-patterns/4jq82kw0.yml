  If I've understood what you mean by 'fluent' correctly Rich, I don't think out parameters *prevent* a fluent interface, but they certainly do make it a lot more awkward to use.

  Jon Skeet wrote a blog not too long ago (which I now can't find) on the TryBlah(out value) pattern, with a different solution using something like the Maybe Type. I really only use it in situations like the example - where I have a series of checks to do which yield values and I want to bail out of the method early if the checks fail.

  Good to hear from you - happy new year! :)
