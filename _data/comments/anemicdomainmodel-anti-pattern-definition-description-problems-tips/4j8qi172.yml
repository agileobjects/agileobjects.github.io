message: QConsultancy or contract based work does demonstrate more apathy towards writing good code. I've found that since I've worked for companies that offer software as a service, we evaluate our need for code alot more. Every bit of code is a liability, as it all needs to be maintained, so we try any code we do write as maintainable as possible, otherwise we end up wasting developer time when we need to enhance or change a subsystem, as the poor developer has to spend time trying to understand the software, rather than being able to dive straight in.
