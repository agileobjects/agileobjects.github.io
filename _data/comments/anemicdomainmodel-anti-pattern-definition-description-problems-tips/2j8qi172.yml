message: I feel your pain, Simon - that's more or less exactly my experience. It is a sad fact that most developers 'learn to code', then go on for years collecting their pay cheques and paying little or no attention to what's happening in the industry outside their office walls. I've been lucky enough to work with some really good programmers and architects, but they're a small minority. For whatever reason, it's the nature of our industry.
