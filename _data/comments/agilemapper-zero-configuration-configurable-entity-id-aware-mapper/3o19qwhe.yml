  Congratulations for this great idea and implementation!

  I just have a suggestion:<br />
  Why, instead of developing another new (an awesome) mapper like this one, not to help with your brilliant ideas the development and improvement of other awesome ones, like my current favorite: [https://github.com/fluentsprings/ExpressMapper](https://github.com/fluentsprings/ExpressMapper)?

  I dream with the day when there will be one to rule them all!
