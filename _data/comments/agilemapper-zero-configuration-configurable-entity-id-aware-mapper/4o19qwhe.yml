  Hi Robert!

  Thanks! I have to admit, ExpressMapper is a new one on me - I'll add it to future posts comparing features and performance.

  I had specific ideas for things I wanted my mapper to do which didn't sit easily with existing mappers. AutoMapper (and ExpressMapper by the look of it) require up-front registration of the types you want to map - I didn't want to demand that. I wanted to surface the execution plans - I didn't know if that would fit into any of the existing options.

  Still - thanks for the feedback! :)
