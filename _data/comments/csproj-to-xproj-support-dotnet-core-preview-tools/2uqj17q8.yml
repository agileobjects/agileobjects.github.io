message: Definitely looks like a useful project, but it doesn't target .NET Standard 1.0 (1.3 is the earliest version) and it has an Apache licence where I use MIT. I'm also kind of reluctant to build in a dependency on another package for the sake of the few extension methods I had to write. Will come in very handy for others though, I'm sure! :)
