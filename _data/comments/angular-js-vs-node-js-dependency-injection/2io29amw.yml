  Thanks for the correction on the module bit - I didn't realise it was synchronous module loading in Node... I don't have strong feelings about sync vs async for module loading on the server, but it's easy to see the advantages on the client. There's then a question of whether you want different methods on the client and server if you're developing one application which spans both.

  The example code probably 'fails' because it's TypeScript rather than JavaScript - the 'import' statement is compiled to a JavaScript 'var' so it doesn't fall over.

  Thanks again for your input! :)
