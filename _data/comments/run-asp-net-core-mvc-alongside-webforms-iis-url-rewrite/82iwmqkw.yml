  Hi Steve ... this is a helpful article. I have a couple questions though:

  1) Using this approach how do you route requests from the Core site back to the Web Forms site? Where it's on a different port number would it require a corresponding rewrite section in it's config?

  2) Can this setup be achieved on developers machines using Visual Studio and IIS Express without the need for a publish of the Core site?

  Thanks,<br />
  Gavin
