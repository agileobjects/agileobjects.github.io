  Hey Gavin!

  1) If the core website writes URLs in its output to port 80 (or writes relative URLs with no specified port), they'll automatically point back to the webforms site - the URL rewrite happens transparently, so as far as the browser knows the core content comes from port 80.
 
  2) If the rewrite rules point to the IIS Express port and the site is running, I think it will work, yes. I haven't tried it, but I see no reason why it wouldn't be ok :)

  Cheers,<br />
  Steve
