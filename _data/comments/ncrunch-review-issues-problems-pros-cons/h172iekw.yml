  Just 2 minor points!
  
  "NCrunch (currently) costs $159 (about £100) for a personal licence and $289 (about £180) for a commercial one"
  
  You would use the personal one I imagine. All this means is you own it so can take it with you wherever you go.
  
  The commercial one is intended to be used by organisations. That way, when a developer leaves the team, the company retains the licence and can assign it to the next person they employ.
  
  "NCrunch has two 'engine modes' in which it can run tests for you"
  
  I am using 1.41b and it has several engine modes, and you can also design your own. I have one that I sometimes use that runs all tests automatically, unless they are assigned a certain category (e.g. 'Database' or perhaps 'Integration').
