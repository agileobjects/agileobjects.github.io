  Great comparison!<br />
  Would it be hard for you to add AutoMapper 4.x to the result?<br />
  The way I understand things, AutoMapper changed quite a lot in the 5.x version, improving performance a lot. But it's not a straight drop-in replacement for the 4.x version, so I bet there are more than me stuck with the 4.x for yet a while. Seeing how it compares to the others would be nice.

  Regards.
