  Hi!

  What version of VS are you using? I've had a report of an issue installing with VS2017, but I couldn't reproduce it.

  Do you have AgileObjects.ReadableExpressions.Visualizers.Vs15.dll in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\{Version}\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers ?
