  Hi! Just installed the extension... I am just wondering how to use it now :)<br />
  When the debugger break and I get my LambdaExpression object in watch window, is it still displaying the "ugly" version of the expression.<br />
  Do you have any post or wiki on how to use it? can't find any currently.
