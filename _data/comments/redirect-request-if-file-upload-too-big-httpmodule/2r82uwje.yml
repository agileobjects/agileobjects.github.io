  Hi Andy,

  It sounds like what you've run into a file larger than the request length configured in IIS, as detailed [here](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;295626).

  This HttpModule copes with files which are below this value but larger than a "MaxFileUploadSize" value you have in your appSettings; depending on the size of the file you're uploading you should be able to get around it by changing the config values detailed in the knowledge base article.
