message: Cheers, Rob - glad it's useful :) packages.json lists Node packages required for client-side tasks; the list is *managed* using Bower - that's what I meant to say. Node modules use a bower.json to provide details about themselves to Bower, so you shouldn't have to worry about those unless you're writing a Node module. Probably :)
