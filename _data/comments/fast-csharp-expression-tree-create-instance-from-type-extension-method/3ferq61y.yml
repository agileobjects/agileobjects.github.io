  Hi Nadav,

  Thanks very much for the feedback - both good spots! - I've now updated the code. As a lock statement would have to cover the entire Cache method I've attended to thread safety by using the dictionary's indexed setter instead of .Add(); it's possible two threads could overlap inside the method, but they'd both add the same thing to the dictionary, so I *think* it's ok. Thanks again! :)
