message: Yeah, that's a fair point - the performance test results do show Activator.CreateInstance() as faster in the parameterless case, and I did use it for the parameterless overload in my first attempt at these methods. Then again it's the difference between 2 and 5 ticks, so I think personal taste between absolute speed and consistency plays a part in the decision, too.
