  Hi Nadav,

  Interesting findings! I'll have a play around with that myself soon. Thanks!

  The casting I've referred to is from my first attempt at these methods rather than Activator.CreateInstance() - I've never seen the inside of that.

  For the Ticks measurement I subtracted a start DateTime from an end DateTime; I'm vaguely aware that's not the same thing as StopWatch, but I was only interested in relative speeds.
