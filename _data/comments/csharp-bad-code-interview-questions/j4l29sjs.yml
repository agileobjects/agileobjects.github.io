  Here's the ones I picked out in about 30 seconds...

  Place order doesn't belong on Customer. That's like putting a Bake method on a Pizza. The Pizza doesn't cook itself, the Oven cooks the Pizza. Same here. The OrderManager should take the orderReference, products, and customer as parameters.

  orderReference is only checked against "" and not null or whitespace. Should read if(!string.IsNullOrWhitespace(orderReference))

  Usage or newOrder and Product objects without ever checking to see if they are null.

  varable i has no discernable purpose.

  sqlserverdatabase, LoggingService and CommuncationServer should all be injected into the Customer class; and I don't see anywhere that the sqlserverdatabase class is instantiated. I'm assuming the other two are static 'global' classes.

  I'd prefer to use string.Format rather than appending the messages.

  I don't like the usings inside the namespace... but that's stylistic.
