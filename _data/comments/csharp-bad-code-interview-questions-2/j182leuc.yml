message: This was a great exercise. Thanks for sharing. At my company (just a few employees) we do a phone interview then if the candidate sounds like they know something we have them choose a framework sample (usually MVC or NServiceBus) to bring to their interview. Sometimes we ask them to make a small change to the sample. At the interview we have them run the sample, explain what is supposed to happen and then we have them walk us through how the code works. We've been able to weed out about 80% of applicants just because they can't explain sample code. Things like for loops or boolean logic trip them up. It's really quite shocking for us.
