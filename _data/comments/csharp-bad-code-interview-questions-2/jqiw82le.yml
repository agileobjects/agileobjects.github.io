message: "I've had the same experience, Ryan. Another question I ask is: say you have a Switch class which takes a Light object in its constructor and turns the Light on and off via a Switch.Flip() method - what changes would you make to be able to pass the Switch a CarEngine object? The answer is of course to define (something like) an ISwitchable interface, have Light and CarEngine implement it, and pass Switch an ISwitchable instead of a Light. One applicant (who had years of experience!) suggested we make CarEngine inherit from Light. I wasn't sure what to say."
