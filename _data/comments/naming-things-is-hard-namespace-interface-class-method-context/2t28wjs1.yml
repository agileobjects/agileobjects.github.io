  Intellisense is easier to use without the prefix because with it you have to type out 'c u s t o m e r' before you get to the characters which actually differentiate the properties.

  Also (and this is a tiny point, but it's a real one) if it's 'Id' instead of 'CustomerId' then Customer can trivially implement an IEntity { Id } interface (or something like that) if that were to ever come in handy.

  Glad you found it useful in any case :)
