  Thanks for this article, it has reminded me of some very basic and important naming conventions!

  So many times lately I've ended up in situations like

  ```csharp
  class Customer
  {
    int CustomerId;
    string CustomerName;
    // .... etc ....
    CustomerAddress CustomerCustomerAddress;
    // .... etc ....
  }
  ```

  ... and I've felt dirty and wasteful! I forget about the simple point about context making it obviously what it is.

  The only benefit I like is making intellisense easier, any thoughts on that??
