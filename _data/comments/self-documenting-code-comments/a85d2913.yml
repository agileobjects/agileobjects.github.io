  It was a pleasure to read this article, thank you! Beyond the clean layout and design of the blog itself, the content is well-presented and well-written.


  I also agree with your point of view here - I do spend quite a bit of my coding time on naming things. And then renaming them while working out the feature details, and in the end I might rename again. But I always try to start with a name that conveys meaning.
