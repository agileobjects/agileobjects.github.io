My name is Steve Wilkes. I'm a senior .NET programmer and hands-on architect from Bristol, UK.

In my couple of decades' experience, I've architected and written mission-critical, award-winning projects,
introduced Agile methodologies to Waterfall companies, migrated .NET Framework apps to .NET Core, and worked 
extensively in all areas of the web stack. I'm comfortable talking plain English to stakeholders as well as
techie to fellow programmers. I am always practicing, learning and improving. I also have a couple of cats.
They're pretty helpful.

If your codebase keeps throwing up bugs, it takes an age to add a new feature, your application is difficult
to test, or you want to migrate a legacy app to .NET Core, [get in touch](/contact) - I may be able to help!
